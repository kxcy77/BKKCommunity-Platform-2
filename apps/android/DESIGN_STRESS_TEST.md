# BKK Community Android Design Stress Test

Originally reviewed: 2 August 2026  
Clean-handoff verification updated: 13 August 2026

## Verdict

The original interface was readable and structurally faithful to the Phase 2 mockup, but it looked like a classroom prototype rather than a finished community product. The largest causes were square bordered cards, repeated flat colour blocks, weak visual hierarchy, oversized empty areas, generic Material defaults, and no distinctive BKK visual identity.

The redesign keeps the documented information architecture, colours, large type, five-tab navigation, event actions and accessibility intent. It replaces the flat treatment with a consistent visual system built around layered gradients, warm neutral surfaces, rounded cards, subtle elevation, clearer category treatments and stronger content hierarchy.

## What changed

- Added a branded navy-to-blue header with a community symbol.
- Rebuilt the home greeting as a focused daily-summary hero.
- Turned the discount notice into a contained, elevated alert card.
- Reworked quick actions with rounded cards, icon containers and directional cues.
- Rebuilt event cards with a clearer date block, category pill, time, venue and full-width attendance action.
- Reworked discounts and local-service cards to share the same design language.
- Added concise introduction cards to Events, Deals and Local Info.
- Replaced wrapped filter rows with horizontally scrollable chips, preventing awkward multi-row layouts.
- Reworked the bottom navigation using a white surface and restrained blue selection indicator.
- Added reusable shape, surface, outline and muted-text tokens to the theme.
- Preserved 18sp body text and 48–56dp interaction targets.

## Verification status

The cleaned tree now passes `testDebugUnitTest`, `lintDebug` and `assembleDebug` with Gradle 9.6.1 and JDK 21. The redesigned login was launched on an Android 36 emulator, verified as scrollable and exercised at 200% font scaling. API 26, TalkBack and physical-device checks remain release gates and must be captured before distribution.

## Functionality upgrade implemented

- Corrected Today's Schedule so it no longer displays arbitrary future events.
- Added time-aware greetings and Today/This week/Later event discovery.
- Added event search, My Schedule, saved information and a persistent notification inbox.
- Added calendar, map, share, telephone-support and report-information actions.
- Added API-backed cold-start event and discount detail loading for notification deep links.
- Added a visible last-successful-update state while retaining honest demo/offline labelling.
- Preserved the five-item bottom navigation; secondary capabilities remain contextual to avoid navigation overload.

## Not yet proven

- The 200% font-scale emulator test was not completed because permission to change the emulator setting was declined. It must not be recorded as passed.
- TalkBack traversal has not been manually completed screen by screen.
- Real UAT with six elderly participants has not happened.
- Authentication, profile, contact and detail screens inherit the new theme but still need individual screenshot-based design QA.

## Remaining design risks

1. There is no authentic BKK logo, photography or illustration library. The community icon is a temporary brand device, not a final identity.
2. The offline/demo snackbar obscures content on first launch. It is technically useful but visually intrusive; production should use a quieter persistent status treatment.
3. Demo dates and offers make the product feel less credible. Authentic content will improve the interface more than extra decoration.
4. The app still needs empty, loading, long-text and error screenshots for every major screen.
5. Aesthetic approval must include the target elderly users; developer preference alone is not evidence of usability.

## Release gate

Do not call the interface final until 200% font scaling, TalkBack traversal, long-content layouts, API error states and elderly-user UAT have evidence attached to the project documentation.
